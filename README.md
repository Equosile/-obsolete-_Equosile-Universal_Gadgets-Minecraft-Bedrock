- ### 4. Equosile Random Box
  - #### A random item generator used for random signal generating within item sorters
  - #### The current looting-pool is as follows:
<pre>
 Block of Diamond        Block of Emerald        3 * Block of Gold
 Block of Netherite      Block of Lapis Lazuli   3 * Block of Redstone
 64 * Red Sand           Crying Obsidian         9 * Glowstone

  - a random signal generator of the decimal system.

- ### 5. Equosile Universal Gadget No. 2

  - #### Currently it only functions as a random redstone signal generator.

 the nortern face of this block is randomly occupied by a redstone torch,
 such that there is a random redstone signal at that point.

- ### 6. Equosile Dice
  - #### The very first ever existing DICE in Bedrock Edition (at least where I have acknowledged so far)
  - #### It can technically become a random number generator.
<pre>
 The scoreboard declared as "Pip" can store a random integer of which the range is from 1 to 6.
 In order to claim this random number, the block interaction with a dice is needed.
 e.g. Earning 4 Pip-score from right-clicking the Tetrapip-dice
</pre>
#####
  - ##### 6.1. Recipe in Inventory (or Crafting Table)
    - ###### Equosile Random Box -> 3 * Dice
#####
  - ##### 6.2. As for the each Pip (rolling a dice causing a random result)
    - ###### Throw (Default: Pressing 'Q') the Dice Prime.
    - ###### Install the Dice Prime on ground and right-click it.
